# X-MAS CTF 2019 â€“ Sequel Fun

## Challenge

> So I found this login page, but I forgot the credentials :(<br>
 $result = mysqli_query ($conn, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='" . $user . "' AND pass='" . $pass . "'", MYSQLI_STORE_RESULT);<br>
(The query has to return atleast a row, that was the condition)
## Solution

username = **admin**<br>
password = **'-'**<br>
These would result in the following query<br>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='admin' AND pass=''-''<br> (Password is empty, rest is commented out)<br>

This yields the flag.
